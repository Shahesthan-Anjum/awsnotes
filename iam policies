IAM MFA-multifactor authentication
In aws account first u login with with ur email id-that is ur root user
the root user has full permissions and it is best to avoid and enable mfa
the root user has multiple individual users,and we can create 5000 accounts and it dont have any permissions by default(arn-amazon resourse name)
the individual users has can login through three ways cli,management console and API
  ``````for management we wil ise username and password for other two we wil use access key
IAM groups is collection of users and we can create three types of group 
  1-Admin group 2-Development group and 3-Operational group and one user can be member of 10 groups
 we are creating poloicies beacuse we have 3 group and for that we need different permisions for different grup 
thats y we group them in different groups and then apply policies for them and give permissions to perform their differnt jobs role

An IAM role is an identity that has specific permissions
    roles are assumed by users ,applications and their services

Policies are the documents that defines the permission and writtion in json(javascript object notation)
two types of policies=
    1,-Administration access-------it identity based policies---its applied to identities--it is applied to users,groups,roles
    2,-Bucket policy---it is resource based identity--it is directly applied to resources--it is applied to s3 bucket n dynomodb
          resource is an entity that u create in aws

all permissions are denied by default
